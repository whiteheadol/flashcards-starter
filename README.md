## Introduction
The Flashcards project was assigned as a first project in Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Module 2. Students were instructed to work independently and given four days to complete their work. When complete, the Flashcards game is playable entirely in the CLI.

Although students had previously worked with Mocha/Chai testing, this was the first time they wrote tests of their own. I personally feel that working through this project strengthened my knowledge of both unit testing and class to class interaction.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - Mocha Testing Framework
  - Chai Assertion Library

## Features
- When a user runs `node index.js` to begin the game, they'll be told that the game is starting and they have 30 questions in their deck.
- Then, the first answer will appear in the terminal.
- To select an answer, the user will type '1', '2', or '3'. They can also use their keyboard arrows to select their answer.
- Type **enter** to submit the answer.
- Feedback will appear on the screen telling the user if they got the answer correct or incorrect.
- The user may exit the game early with the shortcut **ctrl + c**, however they will not receive feedback on their score if they do so.
